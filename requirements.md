# About

## Ollama interactions

- We need a chatbot interface to interact with Ollama models.
    - It should generate conversation starters for helping the user (i) offload, (ii) reflect, and (iii) troubleshoot specific issues.
    - It should be able to take user input and respond appropriately.
    - It should be able to ask follow-up questions to clarify user input.
    - It should be trauma aware and take an empathetic approach to conversations.
    - It should remind the user it is a bot if it gets too personal.
    - It should be able to indentify times to intervene with breathing excercises, grounding techniques, or other coping mechanisms.
- We need a speech-to-text interface to convert user speech into text input for the chatbot.
- We need something that summarises the session score to a single score. 
    - This score will be plotted in a time series.
- There should be a "Action" plan generator that creates a list of actionable steps for the user to take based on their conversations with the chatbot.
    - This should include things like seek support from manager
    - The aim is to enable and empower the user to seek support from their workplace and existing support networks.
    - The bot should be OK with suggesting escalating even if the user says their management is not supportive.
